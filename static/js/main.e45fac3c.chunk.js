React\n      Hooks (or just \u201cHooks\u201d) allow you to build your entire React app with\n      functional components only. Yes, that\u2019s right, no more classes.

In the next article we will dive deeper into this matter, but for now I recommend to follow the instructions in the attached video above, and then go ahead and try implementing Hooks in one of your projects.
